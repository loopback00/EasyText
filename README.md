EasyText is a system designed for human-LLM cooperation in generating personalized simplified content according to user vocabulary range. EasyText incorporates user feedback at multiple stages. It allows users to input their self-assessed knowledge levels and review simplification suggestions, ensuring that the output is closely aligned with their comprehension abilities. EasyText achieves a better balance between
semantic faithfulness and reduced complexity tailored to individual needs.

- Framwork : The framework is showed in Figure , which consists of two stages: (i) complex text selection via highlighting, and (ii) personalized text simplification according to selected content.

- ScreenShot: Our EasyText web application. The original content inputed by the user is displayed on the left side of the
system , and the simplified result through interaction is displayed on the right side. Users can change the vocabulary
range at the top of the web application using a slider , then system’s suggestions and simplified results will then be
tailored to the selected vocabulary [1]. Upon clicking the View icon , the system’s selection suggestions will be
highlighted in light yellow on the left side of the application [2].Users select content with the mouse and then click
the Edit icon to add a dark yellow highlight, making it visually distinct from the system’s suggestions [3]. Users
select content with the mouse and click the Erase icon to remove the highlight [4]. Users interact with the system
by operating context with adding highlighting and removing highlighting . After clicking the Simplify icon, the
highlighted content is simplified and displayed on the right side of the system [5]. Simplified content is distinguished
by a light yellow highlight.Users can use the remove highlighting function [4] to retain the highlighting effect of
text that is still confusing after simplification. Click the More Easy icon and the system will further simplify the
content that is still highlighted [6]






## 👾 Simple Demo Video

**The online website uses commercial LLM. We have prepared a certain quota of tokens, so this experience link will not always be valid.**

We will show the features of EasyText through a demo video.










# 🚀 Getting Started

## Installation




Easytext uses a front-end and back-end separation structure. We use the flask framework for the back-end.

** Back-end Install (Manually Recommended!)**

**Make sure you have Python >= 3.8**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**After installation, you need to fill in your own GLM4 apikey="xxxx" in getApi.py**

We will integrate more open LLMs and closed LLMs into EasyText in the future.  Will upload after editing and this will not take long.




**Font-end Install **

We provide a quick-to-use version that does not require the installation of any front-end scaffolding. The js resources required for the front-end have been uploaded and can be used with a single click.
